# Using Machine Learning (ML) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for calculating the ground state energy of electrons confined to move in a harmonic oscillator trap.
GitHub repo for second project in FYS4411: Computational Physics II at the University of Oslo. In this project, ML and MCMC are used for calculating the ground state energy of electrons confined to move in a harmonic oscillator trap. Both the interacting and the non-interacting system is studied. The methods are inspired by the work of 

# Structure of code
To run the main library file, a Julia installation is needed. See more at: https://julialang.org/. 

# Testing
Unit-tests are found in tests.jl. To run the tests, use 
```
julia tests.jl
```
