# Variational Monte Carlo (NOT DONE WITH THE PROJECT YET...)
(The structure of the program is based on the example structure given by the teaching staff in FYS4411. See: https://github.com/Schoyen/variational-monte-carlo-fys4411.)

In this project we study particles trapped in different potentials. We start by looking at a non-interacting system, where the there is no forces between the particles in the system. After that we will introduce a new wavefunction where the interactions between the particles are considered. 

## Compilling and running the simulation
To run the desired simulation, you can set up the system in main.cpp. When the desired system is initialized you can compile the code using
`./compile_project` and then run the simluations using `./vmc`.  

## Testing
To test the code, use: 

## Benchmarks
In the folders /Data and /Plots various results are presented. In the /Data folder you will find local energies from various runs of the simluations. The files are named according to the simulated systems. In the /Plots folder you will find plots from some of the simluations, also named according to the system simulated.
